Steps:

* Tokenizing and stemming each synopsis
* Transforming the corpus into vector space using tf-idf
* Calculating cosine distance between each document as a measure of similarity
* Clustering the documents using the k-means algorithm
* Using multidimensional scaling to reduce dimensionality within the corpus
* Plotting the clustering output using matplotlib and mpld3
* Conducting a hierarchical clustering on the corpus using Ward clustering
* Plotting a Ward dendrogram
* Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
